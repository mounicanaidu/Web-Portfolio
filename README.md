## [SlickGrid treeview column grouping - manyamSlickGrid](https://github.com/mounicanaidu/Web-Portfolio/tree/master/SlickGrid-TreeView-Column-Grouping)

manyamSlickGrid born from SlickGrid TreeView combined with Column Grouping feature with advanced JSON processing, aggregations and automatic parent child relationship creation.

Why manyamSlickGrid exists - 
1. Ag-grid enterprise (a beautiful plugin in Javascript, Angular, and many more) is not open sourced and I could not find better plugin than SlickGrid with powerful features yet lot of additional work was needed to get the desired output.
2. Creating parent child relationship that SlickGrid's TreeView needed is time consuming and complex - 
    * Assigning parent array element index to child
    * Making sure child is always indexed below its parent
    * Assigning correct indentation to the rows
    * Creating unique ID
