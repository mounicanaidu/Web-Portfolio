1.  **News App using Flask**: 
A user first opens a page, called index.html (or any valid web page name), where they can read top headlines provided by the Google News API along with specific headlines from CNN and Fox News. The top headlines are displayed in a sliding format (Figure 1). The top headlines from CNN (Figure 2) and Fox News (Figure 3) are displayed in a card format. A word cloud for frequently used words is displayed as shown in Figure 1.
